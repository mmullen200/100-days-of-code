# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Set up a basic A-frame scene and added physics system and animation. I also fooled around with the color scheme. I spent a lot of my time reviewing docs for A-frame and Three.js.

**Thoughts:** My goal is to build a simple breakout game in VR.

The user should see a couple of primitives, like a cube and a sphere.

The user should also see a wall of multicolored blocks.

The user should be able to grab one of the nearby objects with the mouse.

When the user releases the block, it should launch in an arc at the wall.

When the launched object collides with the wall, the wall should break.

I could also turn this into a multiplayer artillery game, or create a simple AI for the player to play against.
