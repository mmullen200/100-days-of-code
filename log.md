# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Set up a basic A-frame scene and added physics system and animation. I also fooled around with the color scheme. I spent a lot of my time reviewing docs for A-frame and Three.js.

**Thoughts:** My goal is to build a simple breakout game in VR.
